# PRIME C-19 — Research Preview

> Noncommercial research snapshot by **Daniel Kenessy**. Pre‑alpha, not production. This page is deliberately high‑level and omits implementation details to protect the work.

## What this is
- Experimental recurrent memory system exploring pointer-driven state on a circular manifold (ring) with stability controls.
- Published early for prior art and transparency; the public snapshot is intentionally minimal.
- License: **PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0**. Commercial use requires a separate agreement.

## Status
- Research prototype (pre‑alpha). No warranty; not an end‑to‑end product.
- Code is retained for archival/research; supporting docs and scripts are withheld in this public snapshot.
- Hypothesis framing is speculative and not a proof of consciousness or general intelligence.

## Efficiency hypothesis (speculative)
- Idea: stable pointer dynamics + ring topology could deliver long-horizon memory with fewer parameters.
- This is a research hypothesis, not a claim of solved intelligence. Treat all findings as tentative until independently reproduced.

## Looking for collaborators
- **Senior Python/ML engineer**: help harden and extend the system.
- **IP/licensing/legal partner**: help structure commercial rights while keeping research access open.
- Collaboration style: small, focused, shared upside; practical and reproducible.
